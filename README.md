# Jo's Website

Hello and welcome to the github of Jo's website :)

I developed this site in late 2024/early 2025 as a space for me to present my thoughts and ideas in a way that feels genuine to me & the various parts of my personality. I also wanted to practice my frontend coding since honestly its still a lil new to me (albeit much less so after v1 of this site!). I'm updating it relatively often -- I post one blog article per month, update the BINJO page each time I make progress on an item, and will continue to add new features / pages / easter eggs as I go.

I hope you en-jo-y ðŸ™‚
