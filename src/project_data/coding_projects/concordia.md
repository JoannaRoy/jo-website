Extended the evaluation logic from our paper '[Argument-based Consistency (ArC) in Toxicity Explanations of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19113)' to the [Concordia library](https://deepmind.google/research/publications/64717/) for generative social simulations, to evaluate agents' reasoning for their decisions within the simulations. Added a [HuggingFace integration](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/pull/169) to Concordia so that their models could be used in the simulations.
