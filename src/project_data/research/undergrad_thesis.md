Often, communities who are most targeted by hate speech online are also less present online (and therefore, their data less influential in LLMs' training corpuses). If LLMs could better articulate the perspectives of groups who are underrepresented online, they may be useful in counteracting hate-speech targeted towards those groups (e.g. by generating responses that refute claims and/or provide additional perspectives on the topic). My project compared different approaches to representing these perspectives in LLM responses, with a particular goal of generating responses that effectively counteract hate speech on text-based social media platforms (e.g. reddit and twitter). I explored model fine-tuning, topic modelling, retrieval augmented generation, and combinations thereof.
