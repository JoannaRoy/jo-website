2-D materials are useful for many applications, but are expensive to synthesize. It is therefore helpful to predict their properties *before* synthesizing and experimenting on them, so we can target our efforts towards materials that are most promising to develop further. This project explored Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a means of predicting bandgap properties of 2-dimensional materials, based solely on their atomic structures. The information about each molecule can be embedded in the nodes of the graph, while the inter-molecular interactions can be embedded in the edges. This approach performed better than traditional ML or vanilla neural net approaches. This allows researchers to predict which applications a given material will be useful for, without needing to devote time and resources on synthesizing it first.
