Many research teams are doing important work examining various dimensions of student mental health – ranging from primary school to university contexts. However, too often, students are only the subject of this research and do not play a significant role in shaping or steering it. Students should be involved in research being done for and about them, so this toolkit aims to support student mental health researchers when engaging students in their research projects. This project was done as a Fellowship with [Inlight](https://smhr.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto, after spending two years as a member/facilitator of their Student Advisory Committee.
