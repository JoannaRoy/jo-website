At the start of the Covid pandemic, many students lost part-time jobs and (particularly international students) may not have been eligible for government financial support – at the same time, campus foodbanks closed and public foodbanks were overwhelmed. Alongside a team of 4 other students, I co-founded a Virtual Campus Foodbank, which provided free produce boxes to UofT students through a partnership with [FoodShare](https://foodshare.net/) (a Toronto non-profit growing produce for food-insecure communities). The foodbank provided food boxes to over 1000 UofT students, many of whom were repeat users during its operation from 2020-21.
