Hello friends :)

I recently watched this video: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzQhTzXQ2VE&pp=ygUNbHlkaWEga2VhdGluZw%3D%3D) and I liked it a lot.

I related to it -- how I started running because my other sport was no longer an option, and how running filled my cup in many of the same ways. Soccer was such a big part of my identity from time I was 8 until the day I got hit in the head with a ball during practice at 16. Concussions are crazy because you lose so many of the things you used to take for granted: thinking, socializing, physical activity, ..., the list goes on. 10 months or so into my concussion, my doctor was still calling me his "17 year old geriatric patient" because I needed the help of a walker to walk up and down the block (this is funny you are allowed to laugh 👵😂).

It's all so wild to look back on, and I am so incredibly lucky that I don't feel the effects of it anymore. But what _has_ stuck with me is gratitude for all the little things I once couldn't do. We are really (really!) lucky to have brains that work and connect to our bodies to allow us to do so many amazing things all the time: learn, connect with other people/animals/nature, maneuver ourselves through the world every day. Not everyone has that, but I often (still) have to remind myself not to take it for granted.

I'm currently in the midst of a training block for the Helsinki Marathon (!!) in May, and have been feeling a tad unmotivated. I wanted to remind myself why I love this sport in the first place, so I wrote this little ode to running -- I hope you enjoy it, and if you are also a runner or sportsperson, maybe you can relate to some parts of it too :)

Without further ado:

**s(miles): jo's ode to running**

it started when I hit my head <br>
I could barely get out of bed <br>
for that whole year <br>
stirred in me a fear <br>
I would not be an athlete again <br>

I grew up loving to compete <br>
what am I if not an athlete <br>
sports were what shaped me <br>
soccer embraced me <br>
but I’m too tired to walk down the street <br>

even soccer was hard at the end <br>
competing with my best friends <br>
”try to look good <br>
and maybe you could <br>
find a top school to attend” <br>

when my head was finally healed, <br>
I couldnt return to the field <br>
so I signed up for a race <br>
unsure how I would place <br>
and immediately saw the appeal <br>

it’s something thats just for me <br>
when I run, I get to be free <br>
my legs get to wander <br>
my mind gets to ponder <br>
I feel like I’m strong as can be <br>

so when I lace up my shoes <br>
I’m always glad that I do <br>
my day could be bad <br>
or my heart could be sad <br>
but I end with a new point of view <br>

it's the feeling of going for a run <br>
that never (ever) stops being fun <br>
the beautiful views <br>
sunrises too <br>
and the high I have once it's done <br>

whether I go faster or longer <br>
running makes me stronger <br>
when I’m going through it <br>
running reminds me I can do it <br>
there is no sport of which I am fonder <br>

yes, some parts are rough <br>
races can be especially tough <br>
I’ve wondered if I will make it <br>
my foot, I did break it <br>
and beyond that, there’s other stuff: <br>

the training is not always fun <br>
waking up before the sun <br>
my legs they are SORE <br>
begging me NO MORE <br>
I just want to get it done <br>

and last, it’s hard not to compare <br>
to become hyper-aware <br>
of how I look, <br>
or how long it took <br>
to finish the race, <br>
my place, <br>
my pace. <br>

but these are the ups and downs <br>
the smiles, and also the frowns <br>
runners highs <br>
chafed thighs <br>
better mood <br>
so much food <br>
blistery feet <br>
chance to compete <br>
take a gel <br>
ow I fell <br>
layers of sweat <br>
new PBs set <br>

it’s the lessons running has taught me <br>
and the joy this sport has brought me <br>
I loved it right from the start <br>
with my whole heckin heart <br>
and I'm grateful for where it has got me <br>
