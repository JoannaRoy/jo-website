I made my personal website in 2024 (here it is: www.j-roy.com), but didn't really share it beyond my close circle of friends and family -- I hesitated to share it publicly because I thought it wasn't 'professional' enough, and because as a software engineer I felt pressure to only share it once the code was 'perfect'. These concerns almost stopped me from even making it in the first place!

But a good friend recently sent me this article that changed my mind: https://substack.com/home/post/p-173276536 (its in French but this one: and this one: have similar ideas). [idea is ‘rewinding / re-wilding the internet’]



I feel like this goes beyond just websites

The reality is, coding this was largely how I learned frontend, and I’m constantly learning new ideas about frontend development through my day-to-day work that make me question how I’ve implemented various features on this site. 

The blog doesn't follow any particular theme: its a mix of 'classic' articles where I've written about topics that interest me, my best attempts at poetry and written german (so far), lists straight from the notes app on my phone, and diaries of experiences that I want to capture and share with anyone who is interested. 

It often seems to me, at least online, like many people have found their niche, and tailor their experiences/everything they put out (eg. on LinkedIn or on their respective sites/blogs) really closely to those goals. 

Meanwhile, I’ve never really been one to ‘pick a lane’ — I studied the broadest, most ‘technical’ engineering program I could find; but gravitated towards mostly ‘non-technical’ projects outside of class. Now, I spend my days coding — in a field that I find interesting and exciting — but outside of that, I’m usually still messing around on completely unrelated projects. 

[my path and interests feel ‘messier’]. [I like to work on hard problems, but I also do plenty of things that aren’t so ‘brag-worthy’/directly related — and I’m not really happy until both those parts of jo are satisfied :) I think thats probably true for others, I just wish there wasn’t so much pressure to only show the former]. [we polish/filter ourselves so much, we often aren’t even expressing our ideas anymore — just the chatgpt-‘enhanced’ version]. 

[So while I am (very) passionate about AI governance and safety, this website is definitely not just that. it has sparkles and easter eggs and my favourite colours and emojis and talks more about what I do in my personal time than in my professional endeavours.] 

It is Jo-coded both in the sense that (a) I coded it, and (b) it captures many different parts of my personality :) and I am very proud of it. [in short, it is ‘wild’]

What’s on there now:
* A blog (which occasionally mentions AI governance, but also many other things: https://www.j-roy.com/#/blog/04_miscellaneou(list)s/jo_to_the_world, https://www.j-roy.com/#/blog/02_jog_with_a_blog/running)
* A ‘BINJO’ card with my goals for 2025 and 2026
* Much more to come soon 

Not so long ago, I knew very little about frontend development. I am definitely still learning, both through projects like this one and through my work at trail — the site is by no means ‘perfect’ — but I’m happy with the state this is in and will keep building on it and learning new things as I go :D. 

As it says on the site: welcome to my little corner of the internet — I hope you enjoy :)
