Hello :) My name is Joanna (Jo) and this is my first blog post.

I think a lot about random topics (_most people do haha_). But I find there’s something really nice about taking these messy, jumbled, and confusing thoughts from my head and putting them on a page to clarify and better understand them. It feels like they become more interesting and valuable when I can fully dissect them on a page and draw conclusions, rather than letting them get lost in my muddled trains of thought.

So: this blog, first and foremost, is a space for me to explore what I think about various topics. The posts will vary quite a bit, in subject matter, length, formality, emoji use, and technicality; and over time, I also hope that my writing will become clearer, more interesting, cohesive, concise, and so on.

I want this to be a space where I try new things — to learn about areas that are unfamiliar to me, to develop and express my views on issues I’m interested in, to consider perspectives that are new or unfamiliar to me, and maybe even to experiment with different types of writing (eg. one day I will slip a haiku in here. you will never see it coming).

I really just want to use this blog to explore and express all the different sides of Jo.

Given this introduction, I thought it would be fitting to open with the train of thought that started it all.

In this (inaugural 😮) article, I will therefore try to explain my conflicting thoughts about whether or not to start a blog in the first place (spoiler: here we are :D), and how each will inform the making of Chickpea Purée 🧑‍🍳.

So without further adieu, here is the very first cup o’ jo, enjoy ☕!

I have long tossed around the idea of making a blog (inspired by friends whose blog articles I enjoy reading—thank you, Martin and Nick; and also Emily if you are reading this for those extremely fun vlogs :).

Formatting-wise, (after a long-time toss-up between podcast, vlog, and blog) I landed on this “multimedia blog” concept (aka in classic indecisive jo fashion, I have kept my formatting options open as can be :D) — and even affectionally coined it: “Chickpea Purée” (upon suggestion from my wonderful colleagues at Trail).

But my decision to turn these blog musings into reality was a tad less straightforward.

On the one hand, I was fairly sure that making a blog would be a net positive in my life. The reasons _for_ starting a blog are relatively simple:

1. **I’ve always loved reading and writing** — although academically I tended to gravitate towards math/physics, I find I’m happiest when I can find some balance between the two (ie social sciences and science). I think when we learn about both, we can use one to learn about the other.
2. **I also like being creative**, so the idea of expressing myself not only through words, but also through videos / drawings / etc is appealing to me. This blog will have mix of different types of posts (some visual, some written, a little vlog or audio entry here and there, etc etc) 🎨
3. **Likewise, I find it very frustrating when I have an idea or opinion that I can’t communicate clearly to someone else.** A blog would be a great way to practice expressing my opinions and ideas about any topic that matters to me, so that I have less trouble communicating them in the future. Practice makes perfect 🤓
4. **I’m in a new country — I’m seeing so many new things and meeting so many new people, but I don’t know as many people as I did in Canada.** So much is changing, both around me and in me, and I’d love to have a place to reflect on and store this information. (yes, that place could be a journal, but I do like the thought of opening up a discussion on my reflections, rather than babbling somewhere I am unlikely to ever revisit. I also like the idea of being held accountable - I will hold my writing to a higher standard if I think others may read it, and this alone will help me improve and potentially take a more critical lens to my ponderings).
5. **I want to have something to look back on.** These posts will inevitably change / evolve over time as I find my voice and become better at communicating. I think it will be fun to look back on these early posts, and compare them to future ones, to see how far I’ve come 😁

But despite this relatively convincing case for pursuing blog authorship, I also had hesitations.

These hesitations are not enough to stop me from making one (wouldn’t be a crazy plot twist: if I made a whole entire blog website, just to write one blog single article, concluding that I will not in fact write a blog :D) — but, I do think these hesitations (a) were useful to think/write about before starting the actual blog content, and (b) will inform the content and format of the blog going forward — so I wanted to mention them here:

1. **I wasn't (still am not) completely sure what I want to talk about.**

I’ve had so many miscellaneous ideas and suggestions for topics, tone (should it be personal? professional? formal? informal?), and the format this blog should take (a podcast? videos? written?). The reality is that it will probably be all of these things (and more) at one point or another. The world is a crazy place right now, so there is lots to ponder (!), both good and bad and big and small.

I imagine it will take some time for me to “find my voice” on here. I can be a bit of a perfectionist sometimes, so knowing that my writing will not be perfect, and that it will be publicly available for others to see how not perfect it is, is so scary haha. I will definitely ramble, I will definitely miscommunicate occasionally, and I will definitely miss out on some parts of the topics I explore. Overall, (as with most things in life) it's better to make imperfect posts and improve over time, than it is to not make any posts at all.

2. **I have so many miscellaneous ideas and thoughts, and the task of sorting though all of them feels daunting**.

I was hesitant to start a blog/share my ideas because putting it into a post feels too permanent, as if me writing it here means I have to keep that opinion/that it has to be ‘correct’ or my definitive opinion on a given topic. That said, I’m hoping it can actually be the opposite — that my sharing thoughts and opinions here can open them up to critique or a wider discussion. My thoughts, ideas, and opinions will change; and hopefully the clarify with which I can communicate them will improve too.

I find I’m really good at listening to other people and understanding where they’re coming from, but less good at taking all of those opinions and perspectives, filtering through them, and communicating my own coherent opinions and ideas about the topic. The result is that I change my mind a lot, as I listen to more perspectives on a topic and empathise with each: My opinion just feels like some (weighted) average of all the different perspectives I’ve heard form other people, rather than a representation of my own thoughts on the topic as they relate to/intersect with my values and experiences.

To be clear, I don’t think changing your mind is bad - it's good to be open minded, to have some level of humility about yourself and your opinions, and to be able to question them and admit if you are wrong - but too much of this can make me stagnate, constantly flip flopping and not moving forward in any particular direction. It just generally makes me feel confused and a bit overwhelmed. So I want this blog to be a place where I can sort through all these ideas in order to clarify and build upon them.

That said, sharing my thoughts and ideas publicly is still of course a bit intimidating. Even if I stand by my opinion on a certain topic, and believe wholeheartedly for it to be true; there is always the potential to miscommunicate it, or for it to be misinterpreted by someone else reading it who has different experiences/perspectives than I do. So, dearest readers, I hope that you can bare with me on this one … I’ll do my best to communicate my ideas in a thoughtful, clear way that invites constructive criticism and interesting discussions; but I’m learning as I go, so my ability to do this will of course evolve as I write more, and as the things I write about change.

3. **This third point is less clear in my mind but I’ll try to articulate it tactfully(ish). I am often overwhelmed by the sheer number of people sharing their opinions on internet, commenting on societal issues and suggesting paths forward. The internet gives everyone a platform, and doesn’t always distinguish between or highlight those who have more expertise in the subject area.**

For information creators: there is always a platform to share opinions and get reinforcement from likeminded people (of course, there will also be people who differ in opinions, but this is easily chalked up to ‘haterz gonna hate’).

For information consumers: this abundance of information, paired with algorithms intended to instigate and polarize us, can make it really hard to actually see / appreciate diverse perspectives on the topic.

I often feel tempted to “choose a side” of a given debate just to have some certainty, because listening to/reading all the available opinions and information feels overwhelming when there is so much of it. To preserve this certainty, I may not question my position as much as it perhaps should be — there is always have a wealth of information available that agrees with your perspective, so it is much easier and more comfortable to ignore anything that disagrees with it; and to only read from sources that reaffirm it.

This wealth of information additionally makes it easy to feel like you are an ‘expert’ on a topic, and therefore qualified to comment on it/suggest a path forward (whether by starting to post your own opinions / ideas online, or in day-to-day conversations with friends / in comment sections etc). But in reality, I’m not an ‘expert’ on that much - so why should I contribute to this? will doing so just add more noise to already loud and polarized spaces?

So, I am hesitating to start a blog because I don’t want to add to that. I still am not sure about this.

That said: a big part of my personal motivation for this blog is just me trying to work through and navigate those feelings for myself. Less selfishly, if someone can relate to those feelings, and perhaps my ponderings could be useful in navigating them, maybe it is worthwhile to share them.

4. **The last reason is that sometimes I can be lazy and do not do things simply because they seem like they’ll be a lot of work** 😂 — However, this reason is much less valid than the others and should probably be omitted from my analysis.

Ironically, the first two reasons above stemmed from me having _too many_ thoughts and ideas, which is actually all the more reason to start a blog, in order to put them somewhere. The third reason is complex, and is something I think I should evaluate on a case-by-case basis, to decide whether or not it is my place to comment - and if so, how to frame my comments / contribute to discussions in a way that is useful and constructive. And, well, I already marked case closed on reason #4.

So with that, it was settled: Chickpea Purée is a go 🫡.

I have to say, I had a good amount of fun so far just making my little webpage to host this on, and am excited to see what is to come ☺️.

So welcome to my blog! And consequently, welcome to my brain :) I like it in here (most of the time), and I hope you enjoy your little glimpse into it too.

Until next time! 👋
