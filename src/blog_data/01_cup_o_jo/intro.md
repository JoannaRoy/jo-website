Hello :) My name is Joanna (Jo) and this is my first blog post.

Starting this blog is a bit daunting, for a couple of reasons:

- **I‚Äôm not completely sure what I want to talk about.**

I‚Äôve had so many miscellaneous ideas and suggestions for topics to cover on here (should it be personal? professional? formal? informal?), and the format this blog should take (a podcast? videos? written?). The reality is that it will probably be all of these things (and more) at one point or another. The world is a crazy place right now, so there is lots to ponder (!), both good and bad and big and small.

- **I have so many miscellaneous ideas and thoughts, and the task of sorting though/organizing them feels daunting**.

I was hesitant to start a blog/share my ideas because putting it into a post feels too permanent, as if me writing it here means I have to keep that opinion/that it has to be ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô or my definitive opinion on a given topic ‚Äî but i‚Äôm hoping it can actually be the opposite ‚Äî that my sharing thoughts and opinions here can open them up to critique or a wider discussion. My thoughts, ideas, and opinions will change; and hopefully the clarify with which I can communicate them will improve too.

I find I‚Äôm really good at listening to other people and understanding where they‚Äôre coming from, but less good at taking all of those opinions and perspectives, filtering through them, and communicating my own coherent opinions and ideas about the topic. The result is that I change my mind a lot, as I listen to more perspectives on a topic and empathise with each: My opinion feels like some (weighted) average of all the different perspectives I‚Äôve heard form other people, rather than an [elucidation] of my own thoughts on the topic as they relate/intersect with my values and experiences.

To be clear, I don‚Äôt think changing your mind is bad - its good to be open minded, to have some level of humility about yourself and your opinions, and to be able to question them and admit if you are wrong - but too much of this can make me stagnate, constantly flip flopping and not moving forward in any particular direction. It just generally makes me feel confused and a bit overwhelmed. So I want this blog to be a place where I can sort through all these ideas in order to clarify and build upon them.

That said, sharing my thoughts and ideas publicly is of course a bit intimidating. Even if I stand by my opinion on a certain topic, and believe wholeheartedly for it to be true; there is always the potential to miscommunicate it, or for it to be misinterpreted by someone else reading it who has different experiences/perspectives than I do. So, dearest readers, I hope that you can bare with me on this one ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll do my best to communicate my ideas in a thoughtful, clear way that invites constructive criticism and interesting discussions; but I‚Äôm learning as I go, so my ability to do this will of course evolve as I write more, and as the things I write about change.

- **This third point is less clear in my mind but I‚Äôll try to articulate it tactfully(ish). I am often overwhelmed by the sheer number of people sharing their opinions on internet, commenting on societal issues and suggesting paths forward. The internet gives everyone a platform, and doesn‚Äôt always distinguish/highlight those who have more expertise in the subject area. Instead, [].**

For creators, there is always a platform to share opinions and get reinforcement from likeminded people (of course, there will also be people who differ in opinions, but this is easily chalked up to ‚Äòhaterz gonna hate‚Äô); and for consumers: this [abundance] of information, paired with algorithms intended to instigate/polarize, can make it [really hard] to actually see / appreciate diverse perspectives on the topic.

This wealth of information makes it easy to feel like you are an ‚Äòexpert‚Äô on a topic, and therefore qualified to comment on it/suggest a path forward (whether by starting to post your own opinions / ideas online, or in day-to-day conversations with friends / in comment sections etc).

I often feel tempted to ‚Äúchoose a side‚Äù of a given debate just to have some certainty, because [listening to/reading] all the available opinions and information feels overwhelming when there is so much of it. To preserve this certainty, we may not question our position as much as it perhaps should be ‚Äî there is always have a wealth of information available that agrees with your perspective, so it is much easier / more comfortable to ignore anything that disagrees with that opinion / perspective; and to only read info / sources that reaffirm it.

of course, this forms a feedback loop where many people feel like they know best and can avoid any sources that disagree with them, while being inundated with like-minded sources who will reaffirm their stance.

so, I hesitated to start a blog because I didn‚Äôt want to add to that ‚Äî to add more ‚Äònoise‚Äô to an already very loud and polarized space. I still am not sure about this. but selfishly, a big part of my personal motivation for this blog is just me trying to work through / navigate those feelings for myself. less selfishly, if someone can relate to those feelings, maybe it could help them navigate it too.

- **The last reason is that sometimes I can be lazy and do not do things simply because they seem like they‚Äôll be a lot of work üòÇ¬†‚Äî However, this reason is not super valid and should probably be omitted from my analysis.**

Ironically, the first two reasons above stem from me having _too many_ thoughts and ideas, which is actually all the more reason to start a blog, in order to put them somewhere. So that is where we find ourselves now :) Here are some other reasons I wanted to do this:

- i‚Äôve always loved reading and writing ‚Äî although academically i tended to gravitate towards math/physics ‚Äî i find i‚Äôm happiest when i can find some balance between the two. i think when we learn about both (social sciences and science) we can use one to learn about the other. this is the kind of work i find myself most interested in - academically & professionally & personally.
  - i also like being creative, so the idea of expressing myself not only through words, but also through videos / drawings / etc about my experience is appealing to me. so this blog will have mix of different types of posts (some visual, some written, a little vlog or audio entry here and there, etc etc) üé®
- im in a new country ‚Äî i‚Äôm seeing so many new things and meeting so many new people, but i don‚Äôt know as many people as i did in canada. so much is changing - both around me and in me - and i need a place to reflect on and store this information. that place is going to be here :)
- i want to have something to look back on. these posts will inevitably change / evolve over time as I find my voice and become better at communicating. I think it will be fun to look back on these early posts, and compare them to future ones, to see how far i‚Äôve come üòÅ
- overall, i want it to be representative of me - some posts will be more formal / deep than others; and the topics / ideas i talk about will change as I become interested in different things

Here are the main areas I plan to include\*:

- cup o jo: miscellaneous thoughts and personal reflections
- jog with a blog: stories about my (mainly running, but more generally) outdoor adventures
- [technical stuff]: i am a nerd and sometimes i like to write about it ü§ì
- binjo: a special miniseries about the new years resolution bingo card (aka my NYR accountability meeting)

* This list is subject to change
