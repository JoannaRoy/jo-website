This is a list of words I have learned in the past two years ish - I started keeping a list in ~2023 and update it every so often when someone says / I read a new word (of course I have learned more in this time but this is a solid subset ðŸ˜…). I like to keep track of them, since otherwise I will forget. Also, I think there are some fun words that don't get used too often in day-to-day conversations, but that are great to know when the occasion arises :D. I think it would be also fun to start tracking the context in which I learn them, so new words will be added to the list with the date and context too ðŸ¤“.
