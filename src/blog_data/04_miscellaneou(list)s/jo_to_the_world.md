Here is a list of nice little happy things:

- when you notice yourself smiling but u weren't really thinking about it or aware of it, it just happened :>
- loving a song so much you want to listen over and over
- seeing good friends after a long time
- cat videos heh. they're just so innocently funny
- waking up to snow outside
- snow in general & how pretty it is while its falling
- looking at a mountain covered in snowy trees
- fresh air - on a run, bike, walk. breathing it in and feeling like you wanna put your arms out and swim around in it
- forests! looking at all the trees
- oceans too
- and stars
- sunsets
- sunrises
- the feeling when you wake up from a really really deep sleep, naps included (DEEP TISSUE)
- petting a cat on the street
- chocolate
- the smell of an orange when you cut it open
- laughing really hard. especially if it's unexpected and you laugh so loud other people look at you
- unexpected hello messages from friends
- peeing when u really (really) needed to pee
- deep conversations
- when you smile at someone's dog and their owner smiles back. and vice versa (when someone smiles at my dog and i smile back. not when the dog smiles back lol - although I guess that is nice too)
- smiling at someone on a run and having them smile back
- actually just smiling in general. its crazy how it makes you happy just to do it.
- being confused about feelings and stuff, then hearing a song that puts them into words and sounds just how u meant them
- concerts - people all singing a song together
- really vivid dreams
- the smell when you open a new bag of coffee
- sun after a long spurt of cloudiness
- going back to a cafe you used to frequent and recognizing the barista
- listening to something and then it makes u laugh out loud in public but u didn't mean to laugh so hard and everyone's looking at u hehe
- running chickens
- hopping crows
- a good book
- the first day of not being sick after being sick for a long time
- dogs playing in the park
- a really nice, long run
- feeling like you're really giving something your all, and then having that hard work pay off
- putting on a new pair of (good quality) socks for the first time
- when you put on a new pair of glasses and suddenly the world looks sooooooo much clearer!!
