- when you notice yourself smiling but u weren't really thinking about it or aware of it, it just happened :>
- loving a song so much you want to listen over and over
- seeing good friends after a long time
- cat videos heh. they're just so innocently funny
- waking up to snow outside
- snow in general & how pretty it is while its falling
- fresh air - on a run, bike, walk. breathing it in and feeling like you wanna put your arms out and swim around in it
- forests! looking at all the trees
- oceans too
- and stars
- when you smile at someone's dog and their owner smiles back. and vice versa
- smiling at someone on a run and having them smile back
- sunsets
- the feeling when you wake up from a really really deep sleep, naps included (DEEP TISSUE)
- petting a cat on the street
- laughing really hard. especially if it's unexpected and you laugh so loud other people look at you
- unexpected hello messages from friends
- peeing when u really (really) needed to pee
- deep conversations
- being confused about feelings and stuff, then hearing a song that puts them into words and sounds just how u meant them
- concerts - people all singing a song together
- really vivid dreams
- sun after a long spurt of cloudiness
- going back to a cafe you used to frequent and recognizing the barista
- listening to something and then it makes u laugh out loud in public but u didn't mean to and everyone's looking at u hehe
