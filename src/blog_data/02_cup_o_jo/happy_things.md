# nice little things

- When you notice yourself smiling but u weren't really thinking about it or aware of it, it just happened :>
- Loving a song so much you want to listen over and over
- Seeing good friends after a long time
- Cat videos heh. they're just so innocently funny
- Waking up to snow outside
- Snow in general & how pretty it is while its falling
- Fresh air - on a run, bike, walk. breathing it in and feeling like you wanna put your arms out and swim around in it
- Forests! looking at all the trees
- Oceans too
- And stars
- When you smile at someone's dog and their owner smiles back. and vice versa
- Smiling at someone on a run and having them smile back
- Sunsets
- The feeling when you wake up from a really really deep sleep, naps included (DEEP TISSUE)
- Petting a cat on the street
- Laughing really hard. especially if it's unexpected and you laugh so loud other people look at you
- Unexpected hello messages from friends
- Peeing when u really (really) needed to pee
- Deep conversations
- Being confused about feelings and stuff, then hearing a song that puts them into words and sounds just how u meant them
- Concerts - people all singing a song together
- Really vivid dreams
- Sun after a long spurt of cloudiness
- Going back to a cafe you used to frequent and recognizing the barista
- Listening to something and then it makes u laugh out loud in public but u didn't mean to and everyone's looking at u hehe
