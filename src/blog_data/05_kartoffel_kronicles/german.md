disclaimer: there will be (many) grammatical and probably vocabulary mistakes in here :') but my main goal is go practice german, so feel free to leave corrections in the comment box below. I've written this according to the following rules:

- I need to first try to write on my own. Only then can I look up words that I absolutely don't know.
- I'm only allowed to look up one word at a time. No google translating sentences/paragraphs. New words will be collected at the bottom of the page.
- If I look up a verb, I will include the full conjugation for it (in whatever tense it appears in the paragraph) at the bottom of the page so that I can practice that too.
