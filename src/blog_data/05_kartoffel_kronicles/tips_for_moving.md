This post is somewhere in between a reflection (for myself) and advice/tips (for others) about moving to a new country. I grew up in Toronto but have been living in Munich for 

[If you have the means to do it, I would always recommend moving to a new country]

[Ways it has helped me/skills I've developed]:
- becomming more comfortable in unfamiliar environments
- 'starting over' / building from the ground up -- I worked really hard to get a fancy engineering degree from a fancy program in Canada, but it felt like far fewer people recognized it (had heard of it) abroad. In the end, this was good for me because I had to 'prove myself' with my abilities, not a fancy degree or title.
- getting to know people from all over the world -- I find myself gravitating towards other international people in Munich


### What can be tough 🙁

- **Feeling old friendships fade**. There is the excitement new friendships you are building, but they’re not as deep (just yet). In my first few months in Germany, I felt like I kept having the same superficial conversations over and over and over. Like all of my social interactions had been reduced to: “Hello”, “I’m Joanna”, “I’m from Canada, where are you from?”, “what do you do for work?” etc etc. Then after that meetup / hike / language cafe was done, I would not see that person again 90% of the time. It felt like I was putting myself out there so often, but having so little real connection to other people. I missed my friends and how close we used to be and how comfortable we were around each other. Its hard to watch those dynamics between shift as we each move on with our respective lives, even though we know we are both on paths that are very good for us — daily conversations slowly turn to sporadic catch up calls, which are lovely but miss so much of the crux of what the friendship used to be. Life feels like its happening really fast - it can’t be summarized like a highlight reel in a phone call.
- **Missing family,** and wondering why the heck I would go so far away when you can lose people in an instant and it feels like we should spend as much time together as possible. I care a lot about family - I was always close with my parents and brother growing up, so it feels weird to move away from them and I often question whether I will regret doing so later. Conversely, I know that my visits home are 100x as special as ever before, and that I’ll never ever take my family or friends for granted. For example, I wonder if I would talk to my mum so often if I were still in Toronto, or whether I would ‘put it off till later’ knowing that she’s only a subway ride away.
- **Having grown up differently than those around me** -- when I'm in Toronto, its more likely that the people I'm around/talking to share a similar set of experiences from their upbringing. Even if you didn't grow up together, you have a base level of understanding with each other from having been raised under similar circumstances. Moving abroad, there are far fewer shared experiences to draw from -- even the pandemic is not necessarily common ground since every country handled (and therefore experienced) it quite differently. Because of this, it sometimes feels like I have to give more context, and can be frustrating when someone doesn't understand why I feel a certain way (eg. if that feeling comes from something I experienced before moving, which they would be unfamiliar with). That said, I often find myself highlighting many of my Canadian memories/stories with a lot of pride -- sharing them with people who haven't heard of them before makes me (a) realize how lucky I was to grow up how I did, and (b) feel very patriotic about my country! And beyond that, it forces me to connect with people over different parts of my personality than I would normally turn to in Canada, which inherently helps me develop new/more parts of myself :)
- **The language barrier.** I often feel badly that people need to switch to English to communicate with me. I know it takes extra effort for them to switch to my language, and I also know it limits how much we are able to connect with one another. This sounds small, but its surprising how much this guilt builds up and affects other parts of life (everything just feels a bit harder) -- ranging from relatively small (I have put off doing laundry only because I'm afraid of not understanding the instructions on the machine, I have omitted ingredients from recipes because I was too scared to ask grocery store staff for help -- etc, etc, the list goes on) to more important (my bank didn't have any customer service in English -- I had a problem with my account and ultimately had to summon a trusted friend as a translator). Beyond that, it took some time to adjust to not being able to understand much of what was being said around me — this is sometimes a bit isolating, but it can also be a bit fun to imagine what people might be talking about, or to try to understand bits of what they’re saying. I can never get bored while walking home, since I always have street signs to look at and quiz myself on which ones I understand. 
- **Lastly, being in a new place can just generally feel a bit more alone.** To be clear, this is not always a bad thing. I like to have alone time where I can ponder new things while exploring new places and activities, and it can be nice to have a fresh start. That said, its destabilizing to be away from the people who know well and shared parts of your past. You are who you are partly because of your own internal compass but also because of the people around you — but in a new country, the people around you don’t know the version of you that existed before you came here, or the experiences that led to it. They’re missing big chunks of the puzzle, and sometimes that can mean a nice clean slate, but sometimes it can make you miss the comforts of people around you who _know_ you and get you without you having to explain yourself. The people who you know you can trust and say vulnerable things to. So I miss being around people who shared those big, formative experiences.


### Things that helped me:

**1. BINJO:** 

I started putting a BINJO card on my website, with a (somewhat random/disjointed) set of goals for the year. Every time I made progress towards one of them, I would update the site -- and when I got all five goals in a row/column/diagonal (yes, you guessed it -- BINJO!), I treated myself to a prize :). This activity turned out to be incredibly valuable for a couple of reasons: 

(1) Many of the goals I set out involved pushing myself to do things that were slightly out of my comfort zone -- having them in the BINJO gave me the extra bit of motivation I needed to actually do them. This includes both individual activities (eg. reading X number of books, running X kms, etc), and group ones (eg. hosting X number of events, sending X postcards); 

(2) the items often helped me explore my new country -- I took two day trips per month in 2025, a friend took me clubbing for my first time (its big over here haha), partook in a triathlon organized by a colleague, swim (regularly, now) in the munich olympic pool, tried a dance class, and so on. I imagine I would have done some of them without the BINJO, but I would likely not have gone out of my way to make them happen, and yet I was so so glad to have done each one; 

(3) When you move, many of your routines/regular structures and places you rely on are no longer there. You have to readjust -- find your favourite spots (grocery stores, running routes, cafes, parks, etc) and things to do. The BINJO gave me a semi-structured way to 'throw things at the wall and see what sticks'. 

(4) It's a great conversation starter! I often talk to my friends and colleagues about my progress and upcoming items. Often, people will offer tips and/or words of encouragement for completing them, and sometimes are interested in doing them with me :). I recently published the 2026 edition [here][www.j-roy.com/#/binjo] -- prior to posting it, I was surprised at how many friends were asking me about it/when it would come out/what items would be included (everyone was excited for the launch day!) -- it felt like it had become something (albeit relatively small) that people could come together around. Many have also asked me for the template I used, so I posted it as an npm component [here][https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-binjo]. 

**2. Starting a book club:** 

I'd wanted to join a book club for some time prior to moving, but didn't have time for one because of school and other commitments (I also just didn't know of any happening amongst people I knew). When I moved to Munich, I tried to join some existing book clubs through an app called Meetup, but found they were often already 'full' (ie. had a recurring group of people who consistently went, so the events didn't have open/extra places). 

So I decided to start one myself. I created a group on Meetup called 'Munich Book Club' and, within a week or so, had over 150 users join. This is of course way too many people to have in a book club, so each event was limited to ~10-12 attendees. We met at a cafe downtown, and ended up getting a pretty regular crowd of returning members. 

My favourite part about this book club is how it exposes me to people who I probably never would have spent time with otherwise. We all come from very different backgrounds and have relatively different (including literary) interests. There are people from all over the world -- we initially connected over whichever book we read each month, but have also had many good conversations about topics completely unrelated to books. 

I was nervous about bringing so many people together when I didn't know them and had no way to guarantee that we would get along/enjoy our time together, but it worked out surprisingly well (plus, I loved reading their book suggestions!). Now, we have a relatively active group chat and a monthly meeting that I consistently look forward to and enjoy :)

**3. Connecting with other people who have moved abroad:** 

This tip is probably more common/traditional than the ones above, but it has really helped me so I wanted to highlight it anyways.

**4. Choose your job wisely:** 

A workplace that was extremely welcoming and supportive (they feel like my german 'family')

[I can't imagine moving to a new country and working in a less supportive environment]

Being in a new country can be a bit isolating at times, so going out of your way to do things that will help you connect with people is so worthwhile. Even if you don't do a BINJO, you can (and should) try new things -- the best part of being in a new country is that people are unlikely to recognize you if you totally embarass yourself in the process :D
