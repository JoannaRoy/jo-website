Guten morgen 🙂 ! Todays blog post starts with a passage written in (my currently very broken) German, where I talk a bit about my adventures here so far. If you speak German and you are reading this, I apologize in advance for the grammar 😅 - stay tuned for a sequel a couple months from now when I will hopefully have made vast improvements in this domain!

After the German portion, I list some rapid-fire reflections on my experiences living in a new country. I intend to do a more thorough analysis on this topic in a later post, but its nice to get snapshots of whats on my mind at this point so I can look back on what I’ve learned. Jo who moved here 9 months ago was a baby compared to Jo now, so I want to document the parts of her adventures so far that have helped her grow up.

_Disclaimer: there will be (many) grammatical and probably vocabulary mistakes in here :') but my main goal is go practice german. I've written this according to the following rules:_

- _I need to first try to write on my own. Only then can I look up words that I absolutely don't know._
- _I'm only allowed to look up one word at a time. No google translating sentences/paragraphs. New words are highlighted and bolded._

Hallo, ich bin Joanna. Ich lebe in Deutschland seit neun Monaten, weil mein neue Arbeit ist in München. Ich schriebe diese **Blogbeitrag** für mein Deutsch üben. Ich habe Deutschlernen anfangen ein Monat vor ich habe **Umzug nach** Deutschland, aber Deutschlernen ist **hart** und ich müsse **Übungsmöglichkeit** finden oder ich werde kein neue Wort und Grammatisch lernen.

So, ich werde **darüber** sprechen mein Leben in Deutschland bis jetzt. Meine Lieblingshobby is laufen, aber ich mag auch Fahrrad fahren, wandern, Klavierspiele, und ein bisschen Klettern. München ist ein gute Stadt für laufen. Ich wohne nahe der Olympiapark, so ich laufe **dort** im Morgens. **An den Wochenenden**, ich habe **mehr** zeit, so ich kann am Englischergarten laufen. Die Englischergarten is sehr schön zum laufen — ich liebe besonders **neben** der **Fluss** zum laufen, weil der Bäume und die Wasser sind schön und **entspannend**.

Für mein Arbeit, ich bin Softwareentwickler von trail, ein **Plattform** für KI-Governance. Ich mag meine Arbeit und meine Kollegen, weil wir machen viel Spaß und ich habe viel über **Softwareentwicklung** gelernt. Mein Schreibtisch ist in die ‘Tech Zimmer’ 😎 und ich habe ein klein Harry Styles gehäkelt **neben** meinem Computer - wann ich habe eine frage oder ich bin **verwirrt**, ich frage einfach Harry. Weil ich spreche meine frage, ich finde oft die Antwort — Harry ist **daher für mich wie eine** ‘Rubber Duck’ und er ist sehr **schlau** 😍.

Umzug nach ein neue Land ist manchmal hart, aber es ist auch eine **Gelegenheit** zu lernen und immer ein **Abenteuer**. Ich wohne allein, und machmal **vermisse** ich meine Freunde aus Kanada. Nach den Universität, meine Freunde sind alle sehr **unterschiedliche** **Dinge** gemacht. Ich rufe meine Freunde manchmal an für ‘Catch Ups’ und das macht viel Spaß. Ich habe auch der neue Freunde gemacht, und das ist sehr schön. Ich vermisse meine Katze eine Menge. Sein name ist Barney — er ist sehr **lustig**, und manchmal **nervig**, aber auch sehr nette. Barney werde mit mir kommen nach Deutschland aus September.

Das Beste am leben im ein neue Land ist dass ich habe viel **Gelegenheit** für **reisen** zum neue **Städte** und **Länder**. Letzte Wochenende, ich habe meine Freunde in London besuchen. Wir haben die Big Ben und Buckingham Palace besuchen am Samstag, und auch den Marathon gesehen am Sonntag. Ich hatte viel Spaß auf **dieser Reise**. Letzte Monat, ich habe zum Spanien und Frankreich besuchen mit meinem andere Freunde. Ich habe aus vier Städte in eine Woche gelaufen 🥳 und Ich **fand** Spanien besonders schön.

Das ist alle für heute. Mein **Gehirn** ist von Deutsch schrieben sehr **müde**. Ich müsse jetzt mein Schrieben korrigieren. Danke für lesen 🤓

## Germany So Far (Nine Months In)

I want to say that my decision to move to Germany was planned and deliberate. Up until graduating, I’d followed a pretty traditional path — in high school, I knew I’d attend university. I was good at science and math, and my dad was an engineer, so naturally that was what I studied. But coming out of school, the paths were much less well-defined. Having kept my options as open as possible up until that point, it was daunting to pick a specific job and career to focus on. Success is also much less well-defined outside of academic settings — classes have clear metrics for your progress and performance, but ‘succeeding’ in your career can look very different for different people. I had no idea ‘where I saw myself in ten years’ (to be honest, I still don’t).

I lived in Toronto my whole life. Aside from two years of university, I always lived in my childhood home, which happened to be only a couple blocks away from the University of Toronto (where I studied for my undergrad). I had always wanted to explore different parts of the world, beyond just visiting — I wanted to live there, get to know people there, and experience (not just touristy) things I wouldn’t have the chance to at home. I tried to do this at various points during my undergrad, but opportunities were seriously limited by COVID, and the ones I did get (first in Calgary, then in Singapore) were both cancelled or shifted to remote for this same reason. By the end of my degree, my world just felt a bit small — I felt restless and wanted to see the world and grow in ways you just won’t if you stay in the place you were born and raised.

So I applied to trail on a bit of a whim. I was scrolling through a Slack channel, which I had been added to during a Responsible AI conference I’d attended earlier that year, and I saw a posting for a full-stack software engineering role. I applied, and feel extremely (extremely) lucky for how things have worked out since. I (albeit a tad naïvely) took the chance to move to a new continent in a place where I did not speak the language, which of course comes with many ups and downs — but has also been a chance to work with super smart, nice, driven people who not only let me be my silly self, but who I have learned a ton from in my time here so far.

I have lots to say about my adventures so far, but the sections below give a summary of (_some_) of the good, the tough, and the funny :)

### What can be tough 🙁

- **Feeling old friendships fade**. There is the excitement new friendships you are building, but they’re not as deep (just yet). In my first few months in Germany, I felt like I kept having the same superficial conversations over and over and over. Like all of my social interactions had been reduced to: “Hello”, “I’m Joanna”, “I’m from Canada, where are you from?”, “what do you do for work?” etc etc. Then after that meetup / hike / language cafe was done, I would not see that person again 90% of the time. It felt like I was putting myself out there so often, but having so little real connection to other people. I missed my friends and how close we used to be and how comfortable we were around each other. Its hard to watch those dynamics between shift as we each move on with our respective lives, even though we know we are both on paths that are very good for us — daily conversations slowly turn to sporadic ‘catch up calls’, which are lovely but miss so much of the crux of what the friendship used to be. Life feels like its happening really fast - it can’t be summarized like a highlight reel in a phone call.
- **Missing family,** and wondering why the heck I would go so far away when you can lose people in an instant and it feels like we should spend as much time together as possible. I care a lot about family — I was always close with my parents and brother growing up, and I still call my mum very often, so it feels weird to move away from them and I often question whether I will regret doing so later. Conversely, I know that my visits home are 100x as special as ever before, and that I’ll never ever take my family or friends for granted. For example, I wonder if I would talk to my mum so often if I were still in Toronto, or whether I would ‘put it off till later’ knowing that she’s only a subway ride away.
- **The language barrier.** I often feel badly that people need to switch to English to communicate with me. I know it takes extra effort for them to switch to my language, and I also know it limits how much we are able to connect with one another. Beyond that, it took some time to adjust to not being able to understand much of what was being said around me — this is sometimes a bit isolating, but it can also be a bit fun to imagine what people might be talking about, or to try to understand bits of what they’re saying. I can never get bored while walking home, since I always have street signs to look at and quiz myself on which ones I understand.
  Lastly, its silly but sometimes I notice myself trying to over-simplify my english when I’m talking to people who don’t have english as a first language. I have since found out that there is a name for this phenomenon: “linguistic accommodation” — I think this name makes it sound a bit more patronizing than it’s intended to be. It really is in the spirit of trying to facilitate a better conversation by not using words or complex grammar that could get in the way of your discussion, but anyway, sometimes it makes be feel like my english is also taking a bit of a hit haha.
- **Lastly, being in a new place can just generally feel a bit more alone.** To be clear, this is not always a bad thing. I like to have alone time where I can ponder new things while exploring new places and activities, and it can be nice to have a fresh start. That said, it can feel destabilizing to be away from the people who knew or shared parts of your past. You know who you are partly because of your own internal compass but also because of the people around you — but in a new country, the people around you don’t know the version of you that existed before you came here, or the experiences that led to it. They’re missing big chunks of the puzzle, and sometimes that can mean a nice clean slate, but sometimes it can make you miss the comforts of people around you who _know_ you and get you without you having to explain yourself. The people who you know you can trust and say vulnerable things to. So I miss being around people who shared those big, formative experiences.

### What has been good 🙂

- **It seems like Germans have a reputation for being a bit cold and direct — and while I sometimes notice this, I also appreciate how this makes the nice conversations more heartfelt and genuine**. If someone tells you something, you know they mean it and aren’t just saying it from a place of politeness or performative courtesy. If someone offers help, or says they’d love to grab coffee sometime, you can bet they’ll actually reach out to arrange it. Someone once said to me that “Germany is like a coconut” — people can seem reserved at first, and this can be hard to swallow or take you aback (the hard shell of the coconut); but once you get to know them, people are friendly and the honesty seems to lead to deeper, more meaningful connections in the long run (the soft inside of the coconut). I don’t mean to generalize — of course everyone is different, so these are just broad observations.
- **Nice little interactions**. People saying hi and bye as they enter and exit the waiting room at the Dr’s office. Or the grandma who heard my music through my headphones at the gym, and started smiling at me and dancing to it in the change room. Someone helping me learn a new word or phrase. My book club and running groups.
- **Having the chance to connect with to all kinds of people who I never would have known otherwise**. I felt so sheltered in the engineering bubble, like I only ever got glimpses out; but here I _have_ to constantly put myself out there to make new friends, and this means getting to know all sorts of people with all sorts of interests and from all sorts of countries and thats pretty cool.
- **Noticing myself growing up :)** I have responsibilities now that I did not have before, and I have overcome things that I wasn’t sure I’d be able to on my own. I sometimes think about how proud little Jo would be of me. I used to get so homesick, summer camp away from my parents was so terrifying — but now here I am on a different continent alone, and figuring myself out just fine.
- **Slowly watching this new place start to feel like home**. I don’t know if Munich fully feels like ‘my home’ yet, but every once in a while I have moments where I am very glad to get to live here. Walking home or running through Olypark while the sun is setting or rising (its so beautiful!), taking a weekend trip to the alps, seeing all the people in the park or at cafes on a nice sunny day. These are the really, really lovely parts of being here that I hope not to take for granted. Beyond that, sometimes when I go on a trip, I notice myself longing to be back in Munich — for my routines and friends. It can be scary to feel like _neither_ Toronto or Munich is home, but it is also cool to think they are _both_ sort of home. I think I will have more to say about this aspect in a couple of months.

### **Funny little differences from home** 😄

- coloured eggs in supermarkets
- surfing 🏄‍♀️ in the park
- grocery store configurations 😵‍💫
- so many wasps !!
- the lights turn yellow before they turn green :3
- eggs are sold in tens …
  - BUT ALSO in sixes? hmm.
- lots of slugs. had a nightmare where i stepped on a slug.
- smoking? and vaping too
- no air conditioners oh my goodness I am warm
- lederhosen and dirndls everywhere haha
- reusable cups at venues 👊
- biergartens 🍻
  - more places for gathering in general: christmas markets, more parks
- can you get evicted for poor recycling habits ?? 🫣
- the bottle caps are attached to the bottles
- tipping at restaurants - they tell you how much it cost and then you just tell them back how much you want to pay rather than putting it straight into the machine
- bikes - people don’t steal them here nearly as much! I see so many people just leaving their bikes, totally unlocked or just barely locked, outside of grocery stores and stuff. It’s crazy!
- alcohol at the checkouts
  - and in the parks and trains 🍾
- ‘toilet’ rather than ‘washroom’
