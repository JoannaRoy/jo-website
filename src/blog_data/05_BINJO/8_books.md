Item #8 on the BINJO list is to read 20 books this year. I don't think it's realistic to write in-depth analysis of each book here, but I do want to pick a few and analyze them at some point (stay tuned). For now, here is a list of the books I've read in 2025.

### FICTION

- The Secret History (by Donna Tartt)
- Murder on the Orient Express (by Agatha Christie)
-

### NON-FICTION

- README.txt
- Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl (by Anne Frank)
-
