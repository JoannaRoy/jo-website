Item #8 on the BINJO list is to read 20 books this year. I don't think it's realistic to write in-depth analysis of each book here, but I do want to pick a few and analyze them at some point (stay tuned). For now, here is a list of the books I've read so far in 2025.

#### Legend:

- ğŸ©µ: Fiction
- ğŸ’œ: Non-fiction
- ğŸ’™: In progress
